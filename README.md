# RCM_Specifics_2.0
RCM Specifics was a Data Entry and Processing App, based on Tkinter with suggestion system. 
It was deployed as a Windows Executable.
But the app had a disadvantage that, it could only be deployed on in Windows, in a single device or maximum a set of systems connected through LAN. 
In order to reuse the existing Python code, it was decided that a Progressive Web Application should be made using Django.
Also a additional Vehicle Expense Maintanence System is added in which all the Vehicle Expenses are noted automatically from the Movement Database and other expenses could be added manually through a form.
